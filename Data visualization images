To illustrate my proficiency in the Power B.I. Desktop tool, I've gathered a few datasets and created visualization reports using them. 

1.	Kevin Cookie Company.
In this dataset, I have information regarding the sales, profits, products, etc. from a company that sells different types of cookie products in different countries. 

2.	Payroll Insights Report. 
In this dataset, I have payroll information of a company. The dataset contains information about an employeeâ€™s division, department, hourly rate, etc. I have added filters on the bottom-left side. 

3.	Supermarket Sales Report. 
In this dataset, I have information regarding the purchases made by customers at a supermarket. The dataset included information regarding the product line, amount spent, city of purchase, payment mode, etc. 

With the help of these filters, I get to filter out the data I need for getting answers to specific questions.
